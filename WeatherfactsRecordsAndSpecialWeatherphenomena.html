    <p>This section will contain a list of some interesting facts and records that have something to do with weather. Of course they will be explained as well.</p>
    <p>For example: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Highest / lowest measured Temprature </li>
        <li>Strongest earthquake </li>
        <li>Highest tsunami </li>
        <li>Fastest hurricane </li>
        <li>Most precipitation per m²</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Addetionally there will be information on weather phenomena such as: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Thunderstorms</li>
        <li>Mirage</li>
        <li>Rainbow</li>
        <li>Fog</li>
        <li>Lightning</li>
        <li>Tornado</li>
        <li>hurricane</li>
        <li>Tsunami</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Here is a list of the 5 strongest earthquakes</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>1952 Severo-Kurilsk earthquake</dt>
        <dd> </dd>
      <dt>Number 4: 2011 Tōhoku earthquake</dt>
        <dd>The 2011 Tōhoku earthquake was a undersea megathrust earthquake that occurred off the coast of Japan on Friday 11 March 2011. It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan and it caused a 40 meter high Tsunami.
          The tsunami caused nuclear accidents, primarily the level 7 meltdowns at three reactors in the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant complex, and the associated evacuation zones affecting hundreds of thousands of residents. Many electrical generators ran out of fuel. The loss of electrical power halted cooling systems, causing heat to build up. The heat build-up caused the generation of hydrogen gas. Without ventilation, gas accumulated within the reactor containment structures and eventually exploded. Residents within a 20 km (12 mi) radius of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant and a 10 km radius of the Fukushima Daini Nuclear Power Plant were evacuated.</dd>
      <dt>Number 3: 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami</dt>
        <dd>The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami occurred on 26 December. It was an undersea megathrust earthquake that registered a magnitude of 9.1–9.3 Mw and it was ,caused by a rupture along the fault between the Burma Plate and the Indian Plate.
          A series of large tsunami waves up to 30 metres high were created by the underwater seismic activity and they killed an estimated 227,898 people in 14 countries.
