    <h1>Weather and Climate</h1>

    <h2>Definition of weather: </h2>
    <p>Weather is the sensible, short-term state of the atmosphere at a certain place on the earth's surface, which appears as sunshine, clouds, rain, wind, heat or cold.</p>

    <h3>Here is some general information about weather:</h3>
    <p>Weather is driven by air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place and another.</p>
    <p>These differences can occur due to the sun's angle at any particular spot, which varies with latitude. </p>
    <p>The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the largest scale atmospheric circulations: the Hadley Cell, the Ferrel Cell, the Polar Cell, and the jet stream. </p>
    <p>Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow. </p>
    <p>Because the Earth's axis is tilted relative to its orbital plane, sunlight is incident at different angles at different times of the year. </p>
    <p>On Earth's surface, temperatures usually range ±40 °C annually. </p>
    <p>Over thousands of years, changes in Earth's orbit can affect the amount and distribution of solar energy received by the Earth, thus influencing long-term climate and global climate change.</p>
